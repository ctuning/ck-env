ImageNet 2012 validation set is no longer publicly available
and this CK meta-package cannot automatically download it!

If you already have it installed on your machine, you can detect
and register it to work with CK workflows using this command:

$ ck detect soft:dataset.imagenet.val --search_dir={directory where the dataset is installed}

You can also download it via Academic Torrents 
at https://academictorrents.com/details/5d6d0df7ed81efd49ca99ea4737e0ae5e3a5f2e5
and then register in the CK using above command
